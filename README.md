# Ticket Booking System

Develop a ticket booking system API.

Here are the requirements.

- The administrator should be able to add/ edit or remove events.

- For each event, the admin should be able to specify the ticket price specifying ticket type (VIP and regular).

- Admin should also be able to specify the maximum number of attendees.

- Users should be able to view events details and reserve tickets (VIP or regular) NB: One user can reserve up to 5 tickets.

- The user should then be able to get an email notification for the successful reservation.
